This repository contains two assignments for the Simulation and Modeling of Aerospace Systems course of my Master's program in Space Engineering.

The first assignment consisted in the comparison between different solving methods in accuracy, solving time and stability regions.

The second assignment compared causal and acausal modeling, using different programs to model the same problem and analyse the differences in the solutions.

Both projects demonstrate my skills in modeling, analysis, and simulation, utilizing industry-standard tools and methodologies.
