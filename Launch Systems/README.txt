This project, commissioned by the Launch Systems course during my second year of the Master's program in Space Engineering, involved designing a launcher under certain constraints. 

The objective was to design an airborne launch which had to be partially reusable and guarantee a certain amount of payload performance to a given orbit.

In particular I worked on the recovery system of the spacecraft, designing the innovative recovery method and simulating its performance in a wide range of cases.

Furthermore, a secondary project was done for this same course. This included a the use of MATLAB to implement GLOM optimization formulas and utilize them on a set of given data.
