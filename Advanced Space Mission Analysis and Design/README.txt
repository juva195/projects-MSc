This project, commissioned by the Advanced Space Mission Analysis and Design course during my second year of the Master's program in Space Engineering, involved designing the Phase 0 and Phase A of a space mission. 

The objective was to design an Earth Observation constellation in VLEO with minimal latency and very high resolution. Furthermore we had to adhere to some technical and procurement constraints, simulating a real satellite mission design. 7

This project has been submitted to IAC 2025 as two separate papers, one on the control algorithm and mission orbital design while the other highlighted the whole mission and all other subsystems. The latter was accepted to be presented in front of a congress and the first was accepted as a backup paper for IAC.
