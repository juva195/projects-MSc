This project, commissioned by the Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics course during my first year of the Master's program in Space Engineering, involved designing and analyzing the attitude determination and control system of a spacecraft. 

The objective was to implement a control logic and model sensors and actuators in order to perform an initial detumbling, a slew maneuver and a pointing stability- 

We utilized the MATLABÂ® Simulink environment to model the system and simulate its functionality.
